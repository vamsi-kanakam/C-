# C#
C# is a Object object-oriented programming language designed especially for Information Systems.

The Book I referred to learn C# was **"Fundamentals of C# Programming for Information Systems by George C. Philip"**.

This book contains tutorials that give you hands-on experience which most people are interested in a way.

This repo contains C# files in the order I learned.

I used ***Visual Studio*** for creating and designing these programs.
